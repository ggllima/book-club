# Book club

Book Club is a book exchange Startup. The business model works based on the exchange of books by users, each book registered by the user gives the right to exchange, but the user can also buy the book, if he does not offer another book in exchange.

One of the most important tools for this rental business to enable is a business model. An excellent offer and sales volume exchange on the site.

You are a Data Scientist contracted by the company to build a Recommender System that drives the volume of exchanges and sales among users. However, Book Club does not collect or store the books submitted by users.

The books themselves for exchange are sent by users through an “Upload” button, they are not visible on the site, along with their stars, which represent how much users liked or disliked the book, but Startup does not collect or store this data in a database.

So, you can build a configuration system, before building. So your first Scientist job will be done as the following data

- The name of the book.
- The book category.
- The number of stars the book received.
- The price of the book.
- Whether the book is in Stock or not.

This project is an idea taken from this [article](https://medium.com/@meigarom/o-projeto-de-data-engineering-para-o-seu-portf%C3%B3lio-c186c7191823) of the profile [Seja Um Data Scientis](https://medium.com/@meigarom)
